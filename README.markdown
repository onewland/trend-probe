A silly GTK+ client for watching Twitter trending topics. Hits
the server every 5 minutes and overwrites whatever is stored. Supports
highlighting (cycles through yellow, then green, then clear). Also 
supports opening a browser to the search of the trending topic.

TODO
-----
* persist highlights by not overwriting unchanging topics
* ignore topic (with persistence) with right-click ignore
* load a couple sample tweets from the topic
* load data from whatthetrend?
* basic analytics?
