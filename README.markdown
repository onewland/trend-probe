A silly GTK+ client for watching Twitter trending topics. Hits
the server every 5 minutes. Supports
highlighting (cycles through yellow, then green, then clear). Also 
supports opening a browser to the search of the trending topic.

TODO
-----
* force update feature
* persist highlight over multiple executions
* ignore topic (with persistence)
* load a couple sample tweets from the topic
* load data from whatthetrend?
* basic analytics?
* tests? probably not
